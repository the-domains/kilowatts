description: 'Distributed generation is changing the load shape of the grid. Increasingly, the traditional afternoon peak is being replaced by an afternoon valley, when solar generation is at its highest. The valley period is in turn followed by a steep and problematic peak in the late afternoon, as power from solar generation decreases, people return home from work and school, and residential loads increase.'
